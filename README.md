# AIA-BDE
AIA-BDE corpus of FAQs and variations

The AIA-BDE corpus has FAQs, in Portuguese, and reformulations of their questions, to be used in the evaluation of Information Retrieval, QA, or task-oriented dialogue systems.

FAQs are related to the exercise of economic activity in Portugal and were obtained from the former Balc√£o do Empreendedor (BDE), the Portuguese Entrepreneur's Desk, now integrated in the e-Portugal website (https://eportugal.gov.pt/).

They are represented in a file where each line starts with one of the following tags:
  * P: Question
  * VG1: Reformulation of the previous question produced automatically with Google Translate, after translating the question to English and back to Portuguese
  * VG2: Reformulation of the previous question produced automatically with Google Translate, after translating the question to English, Portuguese, English and Portuguese
  * VUC: Reformulation of the previous question, produced manually by Portuguese speaking volunteers in the University of Coimbra
  * VIN: Reformulation of the previous question, produced manually by Portuguese speaking volunteers in the INESC-L2F, Lisbon
  * R: Original answer to the previous question
